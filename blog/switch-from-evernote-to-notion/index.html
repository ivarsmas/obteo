        <p>In my case, I have been an advanced Evernote user for 12 years. Specifically since 2010. When I discovered it a world opened up for me. Until then I had endless paper notebooks, loose sheets, where I wrote down everything: meetings, ideas, tasks, and tried to keep orderly notebooks after other, but even so, every time I went to look for something it was mission impossible, because I had no way to remember, or the dates on what I wrote, or what notebook was in.</p> 
          
        <p>Then I decided to switch to Windows Notepad, and the thing did not improve, it was the same, but digital and therefore editable... but each note or txt file was difficult to find in the folder that saved it, I had to open it to see its contents and therefore to take advantage of everything written down. </p>
